manage all of our state inside one single location
centralize all of our data inside the very root component


BLOG POST PROVIDER (parent)
  React Navigation Stack Navigator (child)
    IndexScreen (child child)
    ShowScreen (child child)
    CreateScreen (child child)
    EditScreen (child child)

Props
  Communicates information from a parent directly down to a child
  Easy to setup
  To communicate data down multiple layers, we have to write a lot of code (prohibitive)

Context (just about moving information across the application)
  moves information from a parent to some nested child
  complicated to setup, lots of special terms
  easy to communicate data from a parent to a super nested child


we have to create a separate function for each operation we's want to take on a blog. (add, edit, delete)
Many functions!

Rather than the 'useState' hook, maybe try out 'useReducer' instead??
